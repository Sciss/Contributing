## Note to Contributors

Hello and Welcome!

[I am](https://github.com/Sciss) eager to work with you. For small changes&mdash;trivial
bug fixes, correcting typos, and the like&mdash;please just submit pull
requests to any of my projects. For larger changes, though, I have to ask you to jump
through a little hoop.

In particular, in order for me to accept any medium or large size patches from you, you will have to
electronically sign a statement that indicates two things:

- You are willingly licensing your contributions under the terms of
  the open source license of the project that you're contributing to.

- You are legally able to license your contributions as stated.

The reason I do this is to ensure, to the extent possible, that I don't “taint”
the projects I manage with contributions that turn out to be improper. This protects
everyone who wants to use the projects, including _you_! If you want a longer explanation,
then you can check out the [CLA Rationale page](https://github.com/Sciss/Contributing/blob/master/cla-rationale.md).

Once you sign the Contributor License Agreement (the "CLA"), I will then be able to
merge your contributions with a clear conscience and with only the friction that results
from the usual technical back-and-forth of a vibrant open source project.

To get started with this process, visit the
[Sign the CLA](https://github.com/Sciss/Contributing/blob/master/sign-cla.md)
page.

If you have any questions about any of this, please raise them by
filing a bug on this project, since there's a good chance that if you
have a question then someone else has the same question too. If it is
really and truly a private matter, then you can mail me
at
[open-source@sciss.de](mailto:open-source@sciss.de).

Thanks, and happy hacking! I am looking forward to your contributions. Cheers,

Hanns Holger Rutz (Sciss)
