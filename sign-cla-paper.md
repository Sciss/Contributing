# Sign the CLA: Paper Edition

Even though I would love to leave the
paper world behind, various jurisdictions require that I also accept
physically signed documents. If you wish to take advantage of this
when signing the CLA, then all you need to do is mail me a document
with the following content:

    [date]
    
    I hereby agree to the terms of the attached Contributors
    License Agreement.
    
    I furthermore declare that I am free and able to make this agreement
    and sign this declaration.
    
    Signed,
    [your signature]
    
    [your name]
    https://github.com/[your github userid]
    [your email address]
    [your address]
    [your phone number]

Replace the bracketed text as follows:

- `[date]` with today's date, in the unambiguous numeric form `YYYY-MM-DD`.
- `[your signature]` with your signature.
- `[your name]` with your name (printed).
- `[your github userid]` with your GitHub user-id.
- `[your email address]` with an email address at which you can be contacted.
- `[your address]` with a physical mailing address at which you can be contacted.
- `[your phone number]` with a phone number at which you can be contacted.

Print out a copy of [the CLA](cla-1.0.md), sign and date that copy,
and attach it to the page described above.

Send it all to:

    Hanns Holger Rutz
    Nibelungengasse 3
