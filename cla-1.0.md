## 1. Definitions

copyright, moral and neighboring rights, as appropriate, for the full term of their existence including
any extensions by You.

"Material" means the work of authorship which is made available by Us to third parties. When this

including but not limited to electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking

## 2. Grant of Rights

### 2.1 Copyright License

(a) You retain ownership of the Copyright in Your Contribution and have the same rights to use or license
the Contribution which You would have had without entering into the Agreement.

(b) To the maximum extent permitted by the relevant law, You grant to Us a perpetual, worldwide,
non-exclusive, transferable, royalty-free, irrevocable license under the Copyright covering the Contribution,
with the right to sublicense such rights through multiple tiers of sublicensees, to reproduce, modify,
display, perform and distribute the Contribution as part of the Material; provided that this license is
conditioned upon compliance with Section 2.3.

### 2.2 Patent License

For patent claims including, without limitation, method, process, and apparatus claims which You own, control
or have the right to grant, now or in the future, You grant to Us a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive,
transferable, royalty-free, irrevocable patent license, with the right to sublicense these rights to multiple
tiers of sublicensees, to make, have made, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise transfer the
Contribution and the Contribution in combination with the Material (and portions of such combination). This
license is granted only to the extent that the exercise of the licensed rights infringes such patent claims;
and provided that this license is conditioned upon compliance with Section 2.3.

### 2.3 Outbound License

As a condition on the grant of rights in Sections 2.1 and 2.2, We agree to license the Contribution only under
the terms of the license or licenses which We are using on the Submission Date for the Material or any licenses
which are approved by the Open Source Initiative on or after the Effective Date, including both permissive and
copyleft licenses, whether or not such licenses are subsequently disapproved (including any right to adopt any
future version of a license if permitted).

In addition, We may use the following licenses for Media in the Contribution:
Creative Commons Attribution Share Alike 3.0 (including any right to adopt any future version of a license
if permitted).

### 2.4 Moral Rights

If moral rights apply to the Contribution, to the maximum extent permitted by law, You waive and agree not to
assert such moral rights against Us or our successors in interest, or any of our licensees, either direct or
indirect.

### 2.5 Our Rights

You acknowledge that We are not obligated to use Your Contribution as part of the Material and may decide to
include any Contribution We consider appropriate.

### 2.6 Reservation of Rights

Any rights not expressly licensed under this section are expressly reserved by You.

## 3. Agreement

You confirm that:

__(a)__ You have the legal authority to enter into this Agreement.

__(b)__ You own the Copyright and patent claims covering the Contribution which are required to grant the
rights under Section 2.

__(c)__ The grant of rights under Section 2 does not violate any grant of rights which You have made to third
parties, including Your employer. If You are an employee, You have had Your employer approve this Agreement or
sign the Entity version of this document. If You are less than eighteen years old, please have Your parents or
guardian sign the Agreement.

__(d)__ You have followed the instructions in https://codeberg.org/sciss/Contributing, if You do not own the
Copyright in the entire work of authorship Submitted.

## 4. Disclaimer

__Except for the express warranties in section 3, the Contribution is provided "as is". more particularly, all
express or implied warranties including, without limitation, any implied warranty of merchantability, fitness
for a particular purpose and non-infringement are expressly disclaimed by You to Us. To the extent that any
such warranties cannot be disclaimed, such warranty is limited in duration to the minimum period permitted
by law.__

## 5. Consequential Damage Waiver

__To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event will You be liable for any loss of profits,
loss of anticipated savings, loss of data, indirect, special, incidental, consequential and exemplary damages
arising out of this agreement regardless of the legal or equitable theory (contract, tort or otherwise) upon
which the claim is based.__

## 6. Miscellaneous

__6.1__ This Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of Germany excluding its
conflicts of law provisions. Under certain circumstances, the governing law in this section might be superseded
by the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods ("UN Convention") and the
parties intend to avoid the application of the UN Convention to this Agreement and, thus, exclude the
application of the UN Convention in its entirety to this Agreement.

__6.2__ This Agreement sets out the entire agreement between You and Us for Your Contributions to Us and
overrides all other agreements or understandings.

__6.3__ If You or We assign the rights or obligations received through this Agreement to a third party, as a
condition of the assignment, that third party must agree in writing to abide by all the rights and obligations
in the Agreement.

__6.4__ The failure of either party to require performance by the other party of any provision of this Agreement
in one situation shall not affect the right of a party to require such performance at any time in the future.
A waiver of performance under a provision in one situation shall not be considered a waiver of the performance
of the provision in the future or a waiver of the provision in its entirety.

__6.5__ If any provision of this Agreement is found void and unenforceable, such provision will be replaced to
the extent possible with a provision that comes closest to the meaning of the original provision and which is
enforceable. The terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement shall apply notwithstanding any failure of
essential purpose of this Agreement or any limited remedy to the maximum extent possible under law.
